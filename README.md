# Portfolio

Implementation of my personal website with the purpose of acting as an extension to my resume.

### Tech Stack

* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Bootstrap 

### Features

* Simplistic UI with a different style for each web page. 
* There is also an admin portal so that I could dynamically add the repositories that I want (along with an image) to the **code** page.

### Build Status - *Complete*
